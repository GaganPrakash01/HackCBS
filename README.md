This project is completed using the Framer application. 

Project Overview : This Project is a solution to the online ban of gambling apps that use public money for contents and predictions such as Dream11, Mpl etc.

Karnataka recently banned online games involving wagering, betting and gambling.
Many states have already taken this step to avoid money losses to public based on  hopeful high valued returns.
States:
Assam, Sikkim, Telangana, Nagaland, Odisha, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka

Solution: 

1.Instead of charging a joining fee from the users, they can join any contest free of charge .
2.After selection of a team, the leaderboard will display the rankings based on points scored.
3.The top 30 percent in the leaderboard will receive 'points' proportional to their rankings.
4.These points can be redeemed by the users to avail vouchers by partnering with companies such as zomato, swiggy, cureFit, amazon, Flipkart etc.

Conclusion:

Only half of the revenue earned during the day or match can be given out as points to top 30% users 
The other half is the revenue earned for the company
This way, users don't have to pay any money and the company can make good amounts of revenue.
